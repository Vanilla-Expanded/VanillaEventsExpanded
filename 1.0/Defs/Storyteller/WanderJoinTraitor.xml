    <letterText>A {PAWN_kind} named {PAWN_nameDef} has arrived and is joining the colony. {PAWN_pronoun} is a {PAWN_title}.\n\n[PAWN_pronoun] is willing to contribute, but will not leave voluntarily. If you don't want {PAWN_nameDef}, you can banish {PAWN_objective}, sell {PAWN_objective} into slavery, or simply kill {PAWN_objective}. However, your other colonists may find this disturbing.</letterText>
